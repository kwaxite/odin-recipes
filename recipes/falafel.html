    <div class = "para1">"Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy in the middle, and packed with fresh herbs and spices – what’s not to love? The key to making great falafel is twofold. First, you need to use dried chickpeas instead of tinned ones – that’s what will give your falafel a light, fluffy almost crumbly interior. Second, you want to coarsely grind your soaked chickpeas – if they’re too finely ground, the falafel will be dense.”</div>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g dried chickpeas</li>
        <li>30g fresh coriander, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>30g fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 spring onions, quartered</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1l oil (sunflower or rapeseed)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the chickpeas <div class="w1"> overnight </div>in three times the amount of water. This step is non-negotiable: using dried chickpeas instead of tinned ones is the key to making great falafel that’s crispy on the inside and light, fluffy and almost crumbly in the middle. </li>
        <li>Rinse, drain and dry the chickpeas, then transfer to a <i>food processor </i>and blitz, scraping down the sides as needed, until they resemble finely chopped nuts. A course texture is key here. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the fresh coriander, fresh parsley, spring onions and garlic cloves in the same food processor (no need to wash it) and blitz until coarsely chopped. </li>
        <li>Add the chopped aromatics to the chickpeas, along with the ground cumin, ground coriander and salt. Use your hands to gently toss the mixture until everything is well-combined, then cover and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes. This will allow the chickpea starches to seep out, which will help the falafel keep their shape.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil to 170°C. In the meantime, using wet hands, scoop out a tablespoon of the falafel mix and shape into a ball. Repeat with the remaining mixture. </li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry the falafel until deep brown and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>If making the green tahini sauce, place the ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth. Serve the falafel with the sauce and enjoy. </li>
