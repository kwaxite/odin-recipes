    <p>This quick and easy pasta dish comes together in less than 15 minutes. The sauce itself doesn’t require any cooking and only uses 3 ingredients: jarred red peppers, feta and garlic. Add some rocket for freshness (and veg!) and you’ve got yourself a pretty dreamy dinner.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g dried pasta of choice</li>
        <li>300g jarred roasted red peppers (drained weight)</li>
        <li>100g feta</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>10g fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 handfuls rocket</li>
        <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>sprinkle of pink peppercorns, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Season generously with salt and cook your pasta according to the package instructions, then drain, reserving a ladleful or two of the pasta cooking water. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the roasted red peppers, feta and garlic in a blender and blitz until nice and smooth. </li>
        <li>Pour the sauce into the pasta, along with a splash of the pasta cooking water, and toss over a medium heat until the sauce nicely coats the pasta, adding more pasta water as necessary. </li>
        <li>Divide the pasta between bowls and top with the basil and rocket. Finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt and pink peppercorns. </li>
        
       
    </ol>
