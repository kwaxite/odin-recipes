    <p>Jollof rice is a typical west African dish served daily in homes. It is also used during celebrations such as birthdays, baby naming ceremonies, weddings and festive periods like Christmas. Growing up in Accra, Ghana, this is how we made ours. We always used tomato paste. And as for the rice, we always preferred using basmati.”</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium vine tomatoes, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 red onion, quartered</li>
        <li>2 red scotch bonnet chillies, quartered</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
        <li>25g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>100ml water</li>
        <li>600g white basmati rice</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Place the base ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth. </li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven set over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, then add the tomato purée and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to darken, 3 to 5 minutes </li>
        <li>Pour in the blended base, stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and partially cover the pot with the lid – it will splatter! Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced by about a third of its original volume and the oil begins to separate from the sauce, 12 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir in the curry powder, thyme, stock cubes, bay leaves and water. Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, rinse the rice thoroughly with cold water until the water runs clean, then drain. Add the rice to the sauce and stir to combine. As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and cook for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li> By this point, the rice should have absorbed all the liquid and be cooked through. Remove the bay leaves, give the rice a stir and you’re ready to serve, preferably with grilled chicken and fried plantain.</li>
