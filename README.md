This is my first project
I am really looking forward to getting stuck into this.
By the end of this project I will have improved my skills in HTML and Github. I want to be able to remember the core commands without having to refer to a book or the internet. 
I will also like to improve my skills in using VSCODE terminal and be able to type the common commands without refering to a book or the internet.
